This is the first message Hello_WORLD!
Ok so now I have the initial input query in one file, this function reads THAT file and also appends the query to ANOTHER file
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY COOL! AND A LOT CAN BE DONE IN THE MIX OF THIS!

Hope everything is going well!

Since its not a good idea to ramble on like that, it clearly shows rambling can give you the wrong kind of attention
this Quarantine has been actually a blessing in disguise.
this Quarantine has been actually a blessing in disguise.
because it is during this time i got to realize a lot about myself, kind of what one would say a mirror-like-structured phenomenon
because it made me realize when this whole time i thought i was alone in my efforts, going nuts trying to put all this pressure on myself....the people im trying to help are trying to hint at me that 'okay we are ready to get started with working on it when you are' type of thing.  I humbly do respect the approach its incredible how the recruiting process for major doors into the sphere of influence i've been trying to get involved with so I can put my high avid learning energy to good use for all the right reasons 
because it made me realize that you cant unload your problems onto others because it will come back in the form of even more problems to figure out and solve while figuring out how to create a TRUELY PRIVATE NETWORK but in the use of defense only. 'look at it like a personal sonar that lets you know every possible key detail necessary in ensuring impossible security breach'
CLEARLY_THERE_ARE_RULES_AND_GUIDLINES TO THE LIMITS OF HOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF IN THE WRONG HANDS IS NOT GOOD.....WHICH IS WHY IM EXPLAINING ALL OF THIS HEAR...KNOWING...WHO I AM AWARE OF THAT CAN SEE THIS
SO WITH A WORKING PROTOTYPE OF SUCH A SOFTWARE. IT WILL INITIALLY BE SHARED WITH THE PARTIES THAT ALREADY DEAL WITH THAT FIELD TO HOPEFULLY HELP AS SOMETHING SOMETHING IN A US GOVENRMENT AGENCY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AS A TOOL AS A NEW MEANS OF VERIFICATION AND SAFETY
so with all that being said, I know how big of an application that will be to handle alone. Most of these data breaches that have been televized for years all come down to one to two things, either source code access was passed along from internal to external party, or the latter just an open hole someone saw, due to negligent data handling. Which makes it paramount as to whom I work with. I'm trying to learn every aspect along the way since my first day of coding bootcamp for understanding websites
understanding the concepts that allow us to interact with the WWW all the way from the website down to the C level and assembly machine code level
understanding the concepts of OOP really helped me understand myself and the world i live in so much because it has a label for everything
being on the spectrum is a blessing and not a curse
one must learn how to find they way across it to understand it
